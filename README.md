# uvot-pipeline
Repo with example scripts for downloading, processing, and measuring photometry from Swift/UVOT data

### Requirements  

These scripts can be used to run the [UVOT-data-analysis](https://github.com/UVOT-data-analysis/) repos written by Lea Hagen (see my own forks for slight modifications and changes). To run, these scripts must be pointed to the installation of uvot-download, uvot-mosaic, and uvot-galphot. These also require the [HEAsoft](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/heasoft/download.html) tools to be installed. 

The requirements.txt file in this repo should have the packages and version numbers of the required packages. The code has not been tested with newer versions of various packages and may not be compatible with previous versions as well.
